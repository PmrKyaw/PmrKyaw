**`Right Understanding 🏹 Simplicity`**


I am a front-end developer who is passionate about user interface and experience. Eager to learn to understand the problem and solve it in the most optimal simple way. The projects that I built are all from scratch, and I strive with my hard work from conception to finished working product.
